Axis One: Basic and Comprehensive Understanding

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the creation of software from the initial idea to the final deployment and ongoing maintenance. It provides a clear set of steps that help developers understand what to build, how to build it, and how to maintain it effectively. The SDLC is important because it ensures software quality, improves project planning, enhances communication among team members, reduces time and cost by detecting issues early, helps manage risks, and supports continuous improvement throughout the product’s life. Modern software projects use SDLC because it aligns well with Agile and DevOps practices, ensures user-centered design, provides scalability for projects of all sizes, and maintains proper documentation and compliance.

The SDLC consists of several phases. During the Analysis phase, the team gathers user needs, defines system requirements, and assesses feasibility using tools such as JIRA or Trello. In the Design phase, requirements are converted into system architecture, UI/UX designs, data models, and workflows using tools like Figma or Lucidchart. The Development phase involves writing and integrating code using technologies such as Java, Python, React, or Node.js. The Testing phase verifies that the software works correctly through unit tests, integration tests, and system tests using tools like Selenium, JUnit, and Postman. During the Deployment phase, the completed software is delivered to users using platforms like AWS, Jenkins, or Docker. Finally, in the Maintenance phase, teams fix bugs, update features, and improve performance using tools like ServiceNow or GitHub Issues.

Across every SDLC phase, three types of requirements must always be considered.
Functional requirements describe what the system should do, such as user authentication, payment processing, or generating reports.
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform, including its speed, reliability, security, usability, and scalability.
Compliance or policy requirements specify what standards or regulations the system must follow, such as data privacy laws, security policies, coding standards, or accessibility guidelines.

These three aspects are applied throughout all SDLC phases. During Analysis, the team identifies user needs, quality expectations, and legal constraints. During Design, they define workflows, plan for performance and security, and incorporate compliance into the architecture. During Development, they implement features, optimize code, and follow coding standards. During Testing, they confirm that features work correctly, evaluate system performance, and validate compliance. During Deployment, they ensure the system runs smoothly in the production environment and follow data protection policies. During Maintenance, they add new features, monitor and improve performance, and update the system to meet new regulations.

Axis Two: Roles and Responsibilities

Throughout the SDLC, different team members play specific roles. The Project Manager oversees the entire process, ensures alignment with goals, resolves issues, approves designs and releases, and monitors performance. The Business Analyst gathers and documents requirements, ensures that the design meets business needs, validates readiness for operations, and collects user feedback for future improvements. The System Architect or Designer translates business requirements into high-level technical structures, creates the system architecture and database design, provides technical guidance, supports QA during testing, and updates architecture during maintenance.

The Developer’s role changes in every phase. In the Analysis phase, developers understand and refine requirements, identify technical limitations, and help define acceptance criteria. During Design, they collaborate with architects to define modules, APIs, data structures, and ensure the design is practical to implement. In the Development phase, they write and integrate code, conduct unit tests, use version control tools, and ensure all components work together. During Testing, developers fix bugs, optimize performance, and support testers with technical clarifications. In the Deployment phase, they assist with packaging code, merging final changes, configuring build settings, and resolving production issues immediately after launch. During Maintenance, they continuously monitor the system, fix new bugs, update features, refactor outdated code, and help implement security patches.

Quality Assurance (QA) testers validate requirements, create test scenarios, execute tests, report defects, and verify fixes. DevOps engineers prepare infrastructure during early phases, set up automation pipelines, manage environments for testing and staging, deploy systems to production, monitor system performance, and manage rollback procedures after launch.

Axis Three: Practical Application (Jewelry Application Example)

To apply the SDLC practically, consider a jewelry shopping application. During the Analysis phase, the team identifies that users need high-quality product images, an AR try-on feature, secure payment options, and a wishlist, while the business needs inventory management, customer analytics, and order tracking. During the Design phase, the team creates an elegant gold-white UI theme, intuitive navigation, and system architecture that includes product, user, and order databases. Prototypes are made using Figma or Adobe XD.

The Development phase involves building the mobile app using Flutter or React Native for the front-end and Node.js or Django with MongoDB for the back-end. Developers implement features such as the product catalog, AR try-on, user accounts, and payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal. During Testing, the QA team performs unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to check AR functionality, loading time, and payment errors. In the Deployment phase, the app is published on Google Play and the App Store, while the back-end is hosted on AWS or Firebase. A pilot release may be conducted for limited users. In the Maintenance phase, developers add new jewelry collections, improve security, fix bugs, and introduce seasonal updates based on customer feedback.

Six-Month Project Timeline

For a six-month jewelry app project, the Analysis phase may take about three weeks because understanding the variety of products and user needs requires detailed research. The Design phase may take one month, as jewelry apps depend heavily on visual appeal and must include elegant UI/UX and complex features such as AR try-on. The Development phase typically takes two and a half months, as it involves building both front-end and back-end systems, integrating AR technology, and connecting payment gateways.

The Testing phase generally lasts one month because multiple layers of testing such as usability, performance, and user acceptance must be conducted to ensure a smooth experience. Deployment may take one week, involving app store submission, backend configuration, and stability checks. Maintenance continues after release and includes adding new features, fixing bugs, updating systems, and improving performance based on user feedback.

Axis Four: Critical Analysis

If an SDLC stage is ignored or poorly executed, the entire project may fail. For example, if the Analysis phase is done incorrectly, the software may not meet actual business or user needs, causing rework, delays, and increased costs. A real example is the FBI’s Virtual Case File project in the early 2000s, which failed because requirements were unclear and constantly changing; the project cost more than 170 million dollars and was eventually abandoned.

If the Testing phase is poorly executed, serious bugs may reach users, resulting in financial loss or system failure. A well-known example is the Knight Capital incident of 2012, where a trading software error caused the company to lose 440 million dollars in just 45 minutes because of insufficient testing. These examples show that skipping or rushing SDLC phases can lead to catastrophic results.

The Maintenance stage is one of the longest and most expensive because software needs continuous updates, bug fixes, security patches, and hosting support. Real users often find new issues that do not appear during testing, and technologies change rapidly, requiring constant adaptation. Despite its importance, maintenance is often neglected because teams focus on launching new features quickly, underestimate long-term costs, or lack proper documentation. Maintenance includes four types: corrective maintenance, which fixes bugs; adaptive maintenance, which updates the system for new environments; perfective maintenance, which adds new features or improves performance; and preventive maintenance, which prevents future issues through optimization and refactoring.

Axis Five: Modern Trends

Artificial Intelligence and automation significantly improve the SDLC. They increase development speed by automating repetitive tasks such as code generation, testing, and deployment. They improve accuracy by detecting bugs early, predicting risks, and enforcing coding standards. They also enhance decision-making by analyzing historical data to estimate time, cost, and technical risks. Additionally, AI supports higher software quality through continuous monitoring and automated error detection.

AI affects several SDLC stages, especially the Testing and Maintenance phases. In the Testing phase, AI tools such as Testim and Applitools automatically create and update test cases, identify hidden defects, and run continuous regression tests without human intervention. In the Maintenance phase, AI-driven monitoring tools such as Dynatrace and Datadog automatically detect anomalies, predict system failures, and perform tasks like auto-scaling or applying minor updates. This reduces maintenance costs and improves the stability and security of the software.
